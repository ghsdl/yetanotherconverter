# YAC2 stands for Yet Another Converter

This project was made in sweatpants with my ðŸ§ .

# url

this project has been deployed on surge, you can find it here : http://yac2.surge.sh/

# stack

React.js 

# what i thought would happen 

- struggling with setState
- struggling with props from parent to child

# what actually happened 

- did struggle at the beginning with onChange and setState
- evidently the state was not being updated
- BUT with patience and thinking, I managed to get it working
- and once i did it was the same basically for each component so it went smoothly
- i really enjoyed coding this converter
- i enjoy css and sass a bit more each time i make a new one

# what i learned from this project 

- i got better at using props to pass data from parent to child especially when it comes to functions
- i got better at using setState to update my app each time it's rendered
- i'm not as a slow learner as i thought i was (and that's saying a lot)
